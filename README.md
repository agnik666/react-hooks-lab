# React Hooks Foundry

A curated collection of reusable React hooks built with plain JavaScript.

This repository is intentionally **not a full application**.  
Each hook is implemented, documented, and demonstrated in isolation to
focus on **core React patterns, correctness, and real-world usage**.

## Why this repo exists

Most frontend portfolios focus on large clone apps.
This repo takes a different approach:

- Emphasize **fundamentals over UI**
- Demonstrate **how hooks are designed**, not just used
- Keep examples small, readable, and interview-friendly
- Serve as a **personal reference** for React hooks and patterns

This is primarily used for:

- Interview preparation
- Revisiting core React concepts
- Discussing trade-offs and design decisions
